  "readme": "# npm-upgrade\nInteractive CLI utility to easily update outdated NPM dependencies with changelogs inspection support.\n\n[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-image]][npm-url]\n\n## What is this for?\nIf you are tired of manually upgrading `package.json` every time your package dependencies are getting out of date then this utility is for you.\n\nTake a look at this demo:\n\n![npm-upgrade outdated packages](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/302213/11168821/08311b90-8bb2-11e5-9a71-5da73682ed44.gif)\n\n## Installation\nFirst, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (at least `v8.10`).\n\nThen install this utility as global npm-module:\n```sh\nnpm i -g npm-upgrade\n```\n\n## Usage\nThis utility is supposed to be run in the root directory of your Node.js project (that contains `package.json`).\nRun `npm-upgrade --help` to see all available top-level commands:\n```\ncheck [filter]          Check for outdated modules\nignore <command>        Manage ignored modules\nchangelog <moduleName>  Show changelog for a module\n```\nRun `npm-upgrade <command> --help` to see usage help for corresponding command.\n`check` is the default command and can be omitted so running `npm-upgrade [filter]` is the same as `npm-upgrade check [filter]`.\n\n### `check` command\nIt will find all your outdated deps and will ask to updated their versions in `package.json`, one by one.\nFor example, here is what you will see if you use outdated version of `@angular/common` module:\n```\nUpdate \"@angular/common\" in package.json from 2.4.8 to 2.4.10? (Use arrow keys)\n❯ Yes\n  No\n  Show changelog\n  Ignore\n  Finish update process\n```\n* `Yes` will update `@angular/common` version in `package.json` to `2.4.10`, but not immediately (see explanation below)\n* `No` will not update this module version.\n* `Show changelog` will try to find changelog url for the current module and open it in default browser.\n* `Ignore` will add this module to the ignored list (see details in [`Ignoring module`](#ignoring-module) section below).\n* `Finish update process` will ...hm... finish update process and save all the changes to `package.json`.\n\nA note on saving changes to `package.json`: when you choose `Yes` to update some module's version, `package.json` won't be immediately updated. It will be updated only after you will process all the outdated modules and confirm update **or** when you choose `Finish update process`. So if in the middle of the update process you've changed your mind just press `Ctrl+C` and `package.json` will remain untouched.\n\nIf you want to check only some deps, you can use `filter` argument:\n```sh\n# Will check only `babel-core` module:\nnpm-upgrade babel-core\n\n# Will check all the deps with `babel` in the name:\nnpm-upgrade '*babel*'\n\n# Note quotes around `filter`. They are necessary because without them bash may interpret `*` as wildcard character.\n\n# Will check all the deps, excluding any with `babel` in the name:\nnpm-upgrade '!*babel*'\n\n# You can combine including and excluding rules:\nnpm-upgrade '*babel* !babel-transform-* !babel-preset-*'\n```\n\nIf you want to check only a group of deps use these options:\n```\n-p, --production   Check only \"dependencies\"\n-d, --development  Check only \"devDependencies\"\n-o, --optional     Check only \"optionalDependencies\"\n```\n\n#### Ignoring module\nSometimes you just want to ignore newer versions of some dependency for some reason. For example, you use `jquery v2` because of the old IE support and don't want `npm-upgrade` to suggest you updating it to `v3`. Or you use `some-funky-module@6.6.5` and know that the new version `6.6.6` contains a bug that breaks your app.\n\nYou can handle these situations by ignoring such modules. You can do it in two ways: choosing `Ignore` during update process or using `npm ignore add` command.\n\nYou will asked two questions. First is a version range to ignore. It should be a valid [semver](http://semver.org/) version. Here are a few examples:\n* `6.6.6` - will ignore only version `6.6.6`. When the next version after `6.6.6` will be published `npm-upgrade` will suggest to update it. Can be used in `some-funky-module` example above.\n* `>2` - will ignore all versions starting from `3.0.0`. Can be used in `jquery v2` example above.\n* `6.6.x || 6.7.x` - will ignore all `6.6.x` and `6.7.x` versions.\n* `*` - will ignore all new versions.\n\nAnd after that `npm-upgrade` will ask about the ignore reason. The answer is optional but is strongly recommended because it will help to explain your motivation to your сolleagues and to yourself after a few months.\n\nAll the data about ignored modules will be stored in `.npm-upgrade.json` file next to your project's `package.json`.\n\n### `ignore` command\nIt will help you manage ignored modules. See [Ignoring module](#ignoring-module) section for more details.\nIt has the following subcommands:\n```\nnpm-upgrade ignore <command>\n\nCommands:\n  add [module]        Add module to ignored list\n  list                Show the list of ignored modules\n  reset [modules...]  Reset ignored modules\n```\n* `add` - will add a module from your deps to ignored list. You can either provide module name as optional `module` argument or interactively select it from the list of project's deps.\n* `list` - will show the list of currently ignored modules along with their ignored versions and reasons.\n* `reset` - will remove modules from the ignored list. You can either provide module names as `modules` argument (separated by space) or interactively select them from the list of project's deps.\n\n### `changelog` command\n```\nnpm-upgrade changelog <moduleName>\n```\nWill try to find changelog url for provided module and open it in default browser.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n**Wrong changelog shown for _\\<moduleName\\>_ or not shown at all!**\n\nYes, It can happen sometimes. This is because there is no standardized way to specify changelog location for the module, so it tries to guess it, using these rules one by one:\n\n1. Check `db/changelogUrls.json` from `master` branch on GitHub or the local copy if it's unreachable.\n2. Check `changelog` field from module's `package.json`.\n3. Parse module's `repository.url` field and if it's on GitHub, try to request some common changelog files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `History.md` etc.) from `master` branch and if it fails, open `Releases` page.\n\nSo, if it guessed wrong it would be great if you could either [fill an issue](../../issues/new) about this or submit a PR which adds proper changelog URL to `db/changelogUrls.json`. There is a tool in the repository for you to make it as easy as possible:\n```sh\n./tools/addModuleChangelogUrlToDb.js <moduleName> <changelogUrl>\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/npm-upgrade.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-upgrade\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm-upgrade.svg\n",
