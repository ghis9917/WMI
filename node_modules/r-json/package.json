See [how to contribute][contributing].\n\n\n## :sparkling_heart: Support my projects\n\nI open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,\nthis takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications *for free*! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).\n\nHowever, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are few ways you can do it:\n\n\n - Starring and sharing the projects you like :rocket:\n - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—I love books! I will remember you after years if you buy me one. :grin: :book:\n - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal.

**Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`\n\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/z6OQI95.png)\n\n\nThanks! :heart:\n\n\n## :dizzy: Where is this library used?\nIf you are using this library in one of your projects, add it in this list. :sparkles:\n\n\n -
