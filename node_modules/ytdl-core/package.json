Written with only Javascript and a node-friendly streaming interface.\n\n# Support\nYou can contact us for support on our [chat server](https://discord.gg/V3vSCs7)\n\n# Usage\n\n```js\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst ytdl = require('ytdl-core');\n// TypeScript: import ytdl from 'ytdl-core'; with --esModuleInterop\n// TypeScript: import * as ytdl from 'ytdl-core'; with --allowSyntheticDefaultImports\n// TypeScript: import ytdl = require('ytdl-core'); with neither of the above\n\nytdl('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A02s8omM_hI')\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('video.flv'));\n```\n\n\n# API\n### ytdl(url, [options])\n\nAttempts to download a video from the given url. Returns a [readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable). `options` can have the following keys\n\n* `quality` - Video quality to download. Can be an [itag value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#Quality_and_formats), a list of itag values, or `highest`/`lowest`/`highestaudio`/`lowestaudio`/`highestvideo`/`lowestvideo`. `highestaudio`/`lowestaudio`/`highestvideo`/`lowestvideo` all prefer audio/video only respectively. Defaults to `highest`.\n* `filter` - Used to decide what format to download. Can be `audioandvideo` to filter formats that contain both video and audio, `video` to filter for formats that contain video, or `videoonly` for formats that contain video and no additional audio track. Can also be `audio` or `audioonly`. You can give a filtering function that gets called with each format available. This function is given the `format` object as its first argument, and should return true if the format is preferable.\n* `format` - Primarily used to download specific video or audio streams. This can be a specific `format` object returned from `getInfo`.\n  * Supplying this option will ignore the `filter` and `quality` options since the format is explicitly provided.\n* `range` - A byte range in the form `{start: INT, end: INT}` that specifies part of the file to download, ie {start: 10355705, end: 12452856}.\n  * This downloads a portion of the file, and not a separately spliced video.\n* `begin` - What time in the video to begin. Supports formats `00:00:00.000`, `0ms, 0s, 0m, 0h`, or number of milliseconds. Example: `1:30`, `05:10.123`, `10m30s`. For live videos, this also accepts a unix timestamp or Date, and defaults to `Date.now()`.\n  * This option is not very reliable, see [#129](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core/issues/129), [#219](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core/issues/219).\n* `liveBuffer` - How much time buffer to use for live videos in milliseconds. Default is `20000`.\n* `requestOptions` - Anything to merge into the request options which [miniget](https://github.com/fent/node-miniget) is called with, such as headers.\n* `highWaterMark` - How much of the video download to buffer into memory. See [node's docs](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_constructor_new_stream_writable_options) for more.\n* `lang` - The 2 character symbol of a language. Default is `en`.\n\n```js\n// Example with `filter` option.\nytdl(url, { filter: (format) => format.container === 'mp4' })\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('video.mp4'));\n```\n\n#### Event: info\n* [`ytdl.videoInfo`](example/info.json) - Info.\n* [`ytdl.videoFormat`](typings/index.d.ts#L22) - Video Format.\n\nEmitted when the a video's `info` hash is fetched, along with the chosen format metadata to download. `format.url` might be different if `start` was given.\n\n#### Event: response\n* [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) - Response.\n\nEmitted when the video response has been found and has started downloading or after any successful reconnects. Can be used to get the size of the download.\n\n#### Event: progress\n* `number` - Chunk byte length.\n* `number` - Total bytes or segments downloaded.\n* `number` - Total bytes or segments.\n\nEmitted whenever a new chunk is received. Passes values describing the download progress.\n\n### Stream#destroy()\n\nCall to abort and stop downloading a video.\n\n### ytdl.getBasicInfo(url, [options], [callback(err, info)])\n\nUse this if you only want to get metainfo from a video. If `callback` isn't given, returns a promise.\n\n### ytdl.getInfo(url, [options], [callback(err, info)])\n\nGets metainfo from a video. Includes additional formats, and ready to download deciphered URL. This is what the `ytdl()` function uses internally. If `callback` isn't given, returns a promise.\n\n### ytdl.downloadFromInfo(info, options)\n\nOnce you have received metadata from a video with the `ytdl.getInfo` function, you may pass that information along with other options to this function.\n\n### ytdl.chooseFormat(formats, options)\n\nCan be used if you'd like to choose a format yourself with the [options above](#ytdlurl-options).\n\n```js\n// Example of choosing a video format.\nytdl.getInfo(videoID, (err, info) => {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  let format = ytdl.chooseFormat(info.formats, { quality: '134' });\n  if (format) {\n    console.log('Format found!');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### ytdl.filterFormats(formats, filter)\n\nIf you'd like to work with only some formats, you can use the [`filter` option above](#ytdlurl-options).\n\n```js\n// Example of filtering the formats to audio only.\nytdl.getInfo(videoID, (err, info) => {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  let audioFormats = ytdl.filterFormats(info.formats, 'audioonly');\n  console.log('Formats with only audio: ' + audioFormats.length);\n});\n```\n\n### ytdl.validateID(id)\n\nReturns true if the given string satisfies YouTube's ID format.\n\n### ytdl.validateURL(url)\n\nReturns true if able to parse out a valid video ID.\n\n### ytdl.getURLVideoID(url)\n\nReturns a video ID from a YouTube URL.\n\n### ytdl.getVideoID(str)\n\nSame as the above `ytdl.getURLVideoID()`, but can be called with the video ID directly, in which case it returns it. This is what ytdl uses internally.\n\n## Limitations\n\nytdl cannot download videos that fall into the following\n* Regionally restricted (requires a [proxy](example/proxy.js))\n* Private\n* Rentals\n\nYouTube intentionally rate limits downloads, particularly audio only formats, likely to prevent bandwidth abuse. The download rate is still faster than a media player can play the video, even on 2x. See [#294](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core/issues/294).\n\nGenerated download links are valid for 6 hours, for the same IP address.\n\n## Handling Separate Streams\n\nTypically 1080p or better video does not have audio encoded with it. The audio must be downloaded separately and merged via an appropriate encoding library. `ffmpeg` is the most widely used tool, with many [Node.js modules available](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ffmpeg). Use the `format` objects returned from `ytdl.getInfo` to download specific streams to combine to fit your needs. Look at [example/ffmpeg.js](example/ffmpeg.js) for an example on doing this.\n\n## What if it stops working?\n\nYoutube updates their website all the time, it's not that rare for this to stop working. If it doesn't work for you and you're using the latest version, feel free to open up an issue. Make sure to check if there isn't one already with the same error.\n\nIf you'd like to help fix the issue, look at the type of error first. The most common one is\n\n    Could not extract signature deciphering actions\n\nRun the tests at `test/irl-test.js` just to make sure that this is actually an issue with ytdl-core.\n\n    mocha test/irl-test.js\n\nThese tests are not mocked, and they actually try to start downloading a few videos. If these fail, then it's time to debug.\n\nFor getting started with that, you can look at the `extractActions()` function in [`/lib/sig.js`](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core/blob/master/lib/sig.js).\n\n\n# Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install ytdl-core@latest\n```\n\nOr for Yarn users:\n```bash\nyarn add ytdl-core@latest\n```\n\nIf you're using a bot or app that uses ytdl-core, it may be dependent on an older version. Make sure you're installing the latest version of ytdl-core to keep up with the latest fixes.\n\n# Related Projects\n\n- [ytdl](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl) - A cli wrapper of this.\n- [pully](https://github.com/JimmyBoh/pully) - Another cli wrapper of this aimed at high quality formats.\n- [ytsr](https://github.com/TimeForANinja/node-ytsr) - YouTube video search results.\n- [ytpl](https://github.com/TimeForANinja/node-ytpl) - YouTube playlist and channel resolver.\n\n\n# Tests\nTests are written with [mocha](https://mochajs.org)\n\n```bash\nnpm test\n```\n",
